The R code with implementation details used in Propensity Score Weighting for Causal Subgroup Analysis by Yang et al. (2021)

1_True_effect.R generates all true causal effects under different simulation scenarios.

2_SGA_simulation.R runs the main simulation study described in paper.

We have also developed a suite of R functions to perform propensity score weighting analysis for causal subgroup analyses. For more details, please refer to https://github.com/siyunyang/PSweight.SGA
